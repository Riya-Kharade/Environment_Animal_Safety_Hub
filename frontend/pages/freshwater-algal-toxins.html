            <h2>1. Overview of Cyanotoxins and Freshwater Algal Blooms</h2>
            <p>Cyanotoxins are potent toxins produced by cyanobacteria, commonly known as blue-green algae, during harmful algal blooms (HABs) in freshwater ecosystems. These blooms occur when cyanobacteria proliferate rapidly due to favorable conditions such as nutrient enrichment (eutrophication), warm water temperatures, and stagnant water bodies. Cyanotoxins pose significant threats to aquatic life, wildlife, and human health.</p>
            <p>Key cyanotoxins include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microcystins:</strong> Hepatotoxins affecting liver function</li>
                <li><strong>Anatoxins:</strong> Neurotoxins causing rapid paralysis</li>
                <li><strong>Cylindrospermopsins:</strong> Cytotoxins impacting multiple organs</li>
                <li><strong>Saxitoxins:</strong> Potent neurotoxins blocking nerve transmission</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Freshwater algal blooms are increasingly common due to agricultural runoff, sewage discharge, and climate change, leading to oxygen depletion and toxin release upon bloom collapse.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="mechanisms">
            <h2>2. Mechanisms of Toxin Production and Bioaccumulation</h2>
            <p>Cyanobacteria produce cyanotoxins as secondary metabolites, often in response to environmental stressors such as nutrient limitation, light intensity, or predation pressure. Toxin production serves as a defense mechanism against grazers and competitors.</p>
            <p>Bioaccumulation occurs when organisms absorb toxins faster than they can eliminate them. Mechanisms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dietary uptake:</strong> Ingestion of contaminated algae or prey</li>
                <li><strong>Direct absorption:</strong> Through gills or skin in aquatic organisms</li>
                <li><strong>Biomagnification:</strong> Toxins concentrate at higher trophic levels due to lipid solubility</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Factors influencing bioaccumulation include toxin hydrophobicity, organism metabolism, and exposure duration.</p>

        <section id="transfer">
            <h2>3. Trophic Transfer Pathways Through Food Webs</h2>
            <p>Trophic transfer describes the movement of cyanotoxins through aquatic food webs:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Primary producers:</strong> Cyanobacteria produce and release toxins</li>
                <li><strong>Primary consumers:</strong> Zooplankton and small invertebrates accumulate toxins</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary consumers:</strong> Small fish and amphibians ingest contaminated prey</li>
                <li><strong>Tertiary consumers:</strong> Larger fish, birds, and mammals biomagnify toxins</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Toxins can persist in tissues, with some species showing selective accumulation in organs like liver, brain, and muscles. Trophic transfer efficiency varies by toxin type and species.</p>

            <h2>4. Neurological Impacts on Vertebrates</h2>
            <h3>Fish</h3>
            <p>Anatoxins and saxitoxins cause rapid neuromuscular blockade, leading to paralysis, convulsions, and death. Chronic exposure affects reproduction and growth.</p>
            
            <h3>Amphibians</h3>
            <p>Tadpoles show developmental abnormalities, reduced swimming ability, and increased mortality. Adults exhibit behavioral changes and reproductive impairment.</p>
            
            <h3>Birds</h3>
            <p>Waterfowl consuming contaminated fish experience neurological symptoms including disorientation, seizures, and death. This affects migration and breeding success.</p>
            
            <h3>Mammals</h3>
            <p>Small mammals and larger predators show neurotoxicity, liver damage, and reproductive effects. In severe cases, this leads to population declines.</p>

        <section id="human">
            <h2>5. Human Health Implications and Economic Costs</h2>
            <p>Humans are exposed through contaminated drinking water, recreational activities, and consumption of affected fish. Health effects include acute poisoning (gastroenteritis, liver failure) and chronic issues (cancer risk, neurological disorders).</p>
            <p>Economic impacts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Water treatment costs: $billions annually in the US</li>
                <li>Fishing and tourism losses</li>
                <li>Healthcare expenses</li>
                <li>Agricultural impacts from irrigation restrictions</li>
