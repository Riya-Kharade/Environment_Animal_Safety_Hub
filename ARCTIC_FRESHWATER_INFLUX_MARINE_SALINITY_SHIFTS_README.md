# Arctic Freshwater Influx and Marine Salinity Shifts

## Issue #2309: Impacts of Glacial Melt on Marine Circulation and Species Composition

### Executive Summary

Arctic freshwater influx represents one of the most profound alterations to global marine systems, with glacial meltwater disrupting ocean circulation patterns, salinity gradients, and marine species composition. The unprecedented rate of freshwater input from Greenland and Arctic glaciers is fundamentally reshaping marine ecosystems, from plankton communities to apex predators, with cascading effects throughout oceanic food webs.

### Scientific Background

#### Arctic Freshwater Dynamics

The Arctic region contains approximately 26.5 million cubic kilometers of freshwater ice, with Greenland's ice sheet alone holding enough water to raise global sea levels by 7.4 meters if completely melted. Current melt rates have accelerated dramatically:

- **Greenland Ice Sheet**: Losing 200-300 billion tons of ice annually
- **Arctic Glaciers**: Contributing 40% of global freshwater influx
- **Permafrost Melt**: Additional freshwater from thawing ground ice
- **Sea Ice Reduction**: Decreased freshwater storage in floating ice

#### Oceanographic Impacts

Freshwater influx creates profound changes in marine physical and chemical properties:

**Salinity Alteration:**
- Surface layer freshening reduces density gradients
- Halocline disruption affects vertical mixing
- Estuarine-like conditions in coastal Arctic waters
- Altered thermohaline circulation patterns

**Circulation Changes:**
- **Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)**: Potential slowdown or shutdown
- **Arctic Ocean Circulation**: Increased freshwater export to North Atlantic
- **Coastal Currents**: Modified flow patterns affecting larval transport
