# Decline of Bioluminescent Marine Organisms

## Issue #2307: Pollution and Warming Effects on Light-Producing Species in Coastal Zones

### Overview
Bioluminescent marine organisms, including dinoflagellates, jellyfish, fish, and squid, are experiencing significant population declines due to coastal pollution and ocean warming. These light-producing species play crucial ecological roles in marine food webs, reproduction, and predator-prey interactions. Their decline represents both a biodiversity loss and a disruption of coastal ecosystem functions.

### Scientific Background

#### What is Bioluminescence?
- **Chemical Reaction**: Oxidation of luciferin catalyzed by luciferase enzyme
- **Light Production**: Converts chemical energy directly into light (up to 100% efficiency)
- **Spectral Range**: Primarily blue-green light (450-550 nm) for maximum water penetration
- **Energy Conservation**: No heat production, highly efficient light generation

#### Major Bioluminescent Groups
- **Dinoflagellates**: Single-celled algae causing "red tides" and milky seas
- **Cnidarians**: Jellyfish, siphonophores, and corals
- **Cephalopods**: Squid and octopus species
- **Fish**: Lanternfish, anglerfish, and deep-sea species
- **Crustaceans**: Ostracods and copepods
- **Bacteria**: Symbiotic and free-living luminescent bacteria

### Coastal Zone Distribution
