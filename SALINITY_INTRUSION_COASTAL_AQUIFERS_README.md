# Salinity Intrusion into Coastal Aquifers - Issue #2235

## Overview

This educational feature investigates the ecological impacts of salinity intrusion into coastal aquifers on freshwater species and riparian vegetation. As sea levels rise and groundwater extraction increases, saltwater progressively invades freshwater aquifers, creating a saline wedge that threatens coastal freshwater ecosystems and the species that depend on them.

## Scientific Background

### Salinity Intrusion Process
Salinity intrusion occurs when saltwater from the ocean moves inland through permeable coastal sediments, displacing freshwater in aquifers. This process is exacerbated by:

- **Over-extraction of groundwater** creating hydraulic gradients toward the sea
- **Sea level rise** increasing the hydraulic head of saltwater
- **Climate change** altering precipitation patterns and recharge rates
- **Land subsidence** lowering land surface relative to sea level

### Impacts on Freshwater Species
Freshwater organisms have evolved in low-salinity environments and possess specific physiological adaptations:

- **Osmoregulation stress** requiring increased energy expenditure
- **Gill damage** from ionic imbalances
- **Reproductive failure** due to altered embryonic development
- **Behavioral changes** including habitat avoidance and migration

### Riparian Vegetation Effects
Riparian plants depend on groundwater for moisture and nutrients:

- **Reduced water availability** as saline water becomes unusable
- **Ion toxicity** affecting cellular functions
- **Soil structure changes** from sodium accumulation
- **Community shifts** favoring salt-tolerant species
