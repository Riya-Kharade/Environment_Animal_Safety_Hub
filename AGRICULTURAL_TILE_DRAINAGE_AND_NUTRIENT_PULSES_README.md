# Agricultural Tile Drainage and Nutrient Pulses

## Issue #2327: Examining Episodic Nutrient Loading into Rivers from Subsurface Drainage Systems

### Overview
Agricultural tile drainage systems, designed to improve crop productivity by removing excess water from fields, have become significant pathways for episodic nutrient loading into surface waters. This analysis examines how subsurface drainage contributes to nutrient pulses that drive eutrophication and water quality degradation in rivers and downstream ecosystems.

### Executive Summary
- **500,000+ km** of tile drainage systems in major agricultural regions
- **40-70%** of total nitrogen and phosphorus loads from tile drainage
- **2-5x higher** nutrient concentrations during drainage events
- **$2.3 billion** annual cost of nutrient-related water quality issues
- **60% increase** in tile drainage extent since 1990

## Scientific Background

### Tile Drainage Systems
Tile drainage involves installing perforated pipes (tiles) 1-2 meters below the soil surface to collect and convey excess water away from agricultural fields. Originally developed in the 19th century to improve crop yields on poorly drained soils, these systems now cover millions of hectares worldwide.

#### System Components:
- **Collector Tiles**: Perforated pipes (typically 10-15 cm diameter) laid in parallel trenches
- **Main Drains**: Larger pipes that collect water from multiple collector tiles
- **Outlets**: Discharge points into ditches, streams, or rivers
- **Control Structures**: Gates, weirs, or pumps to manage drainage flow

### Nutrient Dynamics in Agricultural Systems
Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) enter drainage systems through several pathways:

#### Nitrogen Sources:
- **Fertilizer Application**: Commercial fertilizers (urea, ammonium nitrate)
- **Manure Application**: Livestock waste and organic amendments
- **Soil Organic Matter**: Mineralization of soil organic nitrogen
- **Atmospheric Deposition**: Nitrogen from air pollution

#### Phosphorus Sources:
- **Fertilizer Application**: Phosphate fertilizers
- **Manure Application**: Animal waste high in phosphorus
- **Soil Erosion**: Sediment-bound phosphorus
- **Legacy Phosphorus**: Accumulated from decades of fertilizer use

## Mechanisms of Episodic Nutrient Loading

### Hydrological Controls
Tile drainage creates episodic flow patterns that differ significantly from natural systems:

#### Flow Characteristics:
- **Base Flow**: Low, continuous flow during dry periods
- **Event Flow**: High-volume pulses following rainfall or snowmelt
- **Lag Time**: 1-24 hours between precipitation and drainage response
- **Peak Flow**: Can exceed 10-50 times base flow rates

### Nutrient Transport Mechanisms

#### Preferential Flow Pathways:
- **Macropore Flow**: Water movement through large soil pores and cracks
- **Bypass Flow**: Water avoiding soil matrix interaction
- **Tile Drain Interception**: Direct capture of nutrient-rich water

#### Nutrient Mobilization:
- **Nitrate Leaching**: Highly soluble nitrate ions move with drainage water
- **Phosphorus Desorption**: Phosphate release from soil particles during flow events
- **Particulate Transport**: Sediment-bound nutrients during high-flow periods
- **Organic Matter Flushing**: Dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus

### Temporal Patterns
Nutrient pulses occur at specific times related to agricultural and hydrological cycles:

#### Seasonal Patterns:
- **Spring Snowmelt**: Major nutrient flush following winter accumulation
- **Post-Fertilization**: Nutrient loading after fertilizer application
- **Harvest Period**: Increased erosion and runoff
- **Fall/Winter**: Base flow nutrient transport

#### Event-Based Patterns:
- **Precipitation Events**: Dilution and mobilization effects
- **Irrigation Events**: Nutrient displacement from root zone
- **Freeze-Thaw Cycles**: Soil structure changes affecting flow
- **Storm Events**: High-intensity rainfall causing rapid drainage
