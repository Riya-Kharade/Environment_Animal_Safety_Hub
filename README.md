## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| [Git](https://git-scm.com/) | Latest | Version control |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) | v18.x or higher | Backend runtime |
| [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) | v9.x or higher | Package management |
| [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) | Latest (recommended) | Code editor |
| [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) | Latest (optional) | Database for backend features |

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/motalib-code/Environment_Animal_Safety_Hub.git
   cd Environment_Animal_Safety_Hub
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env    # On Windows: copy .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. **Initialize the database (optional)**
   ```bash
   npm run init-db
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **View the application**
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Frontend: Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser
   - Or use VS Code's Live Server extension for hot reloading

## 🖥 Backend Server Entry Clarification

The official and primary backend entry point for this project is:

`server.js` (root directory)

This file is used by:
- `npm start`
- `npm run dev`
- Production deployments

A previously existing file (`backend/server.js`) was reviewed and removed to eliminate duplication and architectural ambiguity.

All backend routes, middleware, and configurations are centralized and managed through the root-level `server.js` file.
