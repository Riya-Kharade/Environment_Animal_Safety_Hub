# Genetic Erosion in Small, Isolated Reserves - Issue #1912

## Overview

This educational feature explores the critical issue of genetic erosion in small, isolated wildlife reserves. When populations become fragmented and isolated, they experience reduced genetic diversity through genetic drift, inbreeding, and limited gene flow. This loss of genetic variation diminishes the population's adaptive potential, making them more vulnerable to environmental changes, diseases, and extinction. The feature examines the mechanisms, consequences, and potential solutions for maintaining genetic health in conservation reserves.

## Scientific Background

### Mechanisms of Genetic Erosion

1. **Genetic Drift**: Random fluctuations in allele frequencies, especially pronounced in small populations
2. **Inbreeding Depression**: Reduced fitness due to increased homozygosity of deleterious alleles
3. **Founder Effect**: Loss of genetic diversity when a new population is established by a small number of individuals
4. **Bottleneck Effect**: Severe reduction in population size leading to permanent loss of alleles

### Critical Thresholds

- **Minimum Viable Population (MVP)**: Typically 500-5000 individuals for short-term survival
- **Genetic MVP**: 1000-5000 individuals needed to maintain evolutionary potential
- **Effective Population Size (Ne)**: Actual breeding population size accounting for variance in reproductive success

### Conservation Genetics Metrics

- **Heterozygosity (H)**: Measure of genetic diversity within populations
- **Allelic Richness (AR)**: Number of different alleles at a locus
- **Inbreeding Coefficient (F)**: Probability that two alleles at a locus are identical by descent
- **Genetic Distance**: Measure of differentiation between populations
